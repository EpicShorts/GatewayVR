# The VR Gatekeeper 🛡️🥽

> **"Stop Breaking Expensive Stuff."**

## 💡 The Big Idea
**The VR Gatekeeper** is a concept for an industrial access control system. 

The premise is simple: **You shouldn't be allowed to touch a £200,000 CNC machine until you've proven you won't crash it.**

In the real world, "training" often means reading a PDF or watching a video. Then you get on the machine, make a mistake, and cause £30k of spindle damage.

**My Solution:**
1.  **Scan ID**: Badge in at a VR kiosk.
2.  **VR Challenge**: Prove you can run the "Cold Start" sequence in a 1:1 Digital Twin.
3.  **Unlock**: If (and only if) you pass, you get a digital token that unlocks the physical machine power.

## 🤬 The Problem
*   **Expensive OOFs**: One wrong button press = weeks of downtime and massive repair bills.
*   **Boring Training**: No one learns "muscle memory" from a PowerPoint presentation.
*   **The "Goldfish Effect"**: Safety procedures are forgotten the moment the induction ends.

## 🚀 The Vision
I want to build a "Digital Gatekeeper" that turns safety training into a video game you have to beat to start your shift.
*   **Safe Failure**: Crash the virtual machine? Cool, reset. No cost.
*   **Gamified Competency**: High scores for perfect setups.
*   **Verified Access**: Competency > Seniority.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Website)
The landing page for this concept is built with:
*   **HTML5** (Semantic)
*   **CSS3** (Variables, Grid, Flexbox) - *Designed with a Neo-Brutalist / Cyber-Pop aesthetic.*
*   **Vanilla JavaScript** (No heavy frameworks, just vibes).
